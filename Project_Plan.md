* Is it a **demo**, a **MVP**, or a **full product**? -> MVP
* Are you solving it as a **learning project** or for real users? -> Learning Project

 3. **User and Market Research**

* Who are your **users**? -> children and youth 
* Any **existing tools** solving this problem?
* What can you **do better** or differently?


### ✅ 4. **Tech Feasibility**

* Skills Required:
* Tools Required:
